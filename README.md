Hi, welcome to my SQL repo! ðŸ™‹

During my learning process, I've taken multiple courses and perused many websites with SQL resources where I got to learn and practice SQL questions.
This repository showcases **four SQL-based projects** combined with **Power BI visualizations** to bring data insights to life.
